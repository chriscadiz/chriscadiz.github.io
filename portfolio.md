With over 1.5 million users, HotUKDeals is the largest deal hunting community in the United Kingdom. I worked on both the website and the Android app, and had a blast crafting solutions at such a large scale.

Pepper.com is an ambitious project that I got to build from the ground up last time I was in Berlin. It's a deal platform written in Laravel that I helped architect and deploy in over 10 countries.

Working on the Android apps was a fun challenge too. We had to build robust, configurable apps with maintainability, internationalization, and localization in mind.

A little closer to home, BargainMoose is a Canadian deal community with a focus on content. It's built on a heavily customized Wordpress deployment.

CanRelocate is a Symphony project I worked on back in 2014. The website helps inform prospective newcomers to Canada on the immigration process. It also helps new immigrants with acclimatizing to Canadian life.
